            <p>Heyyyy!! Darlooo🫶,</p>

            <p>
            I just want you to know that how much you mean to me.
            Words can hardly capture the depth of gratitude I feel for having you in my life.
            </p>

            <p>
            You are the person who knows me better than anyone else. You've seen me
            at my best and my worst, and you've loved me through it all.
            Your unwavering support and unconditional care have been my anchor.
            </p>

            <p>
            I admire your strength, your kindness, and your beautiful soul.
            The way you light up a room and make everyone feel valued —
            those are gifts that not everyone possesses.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thank you for the late-night conversations
            and the countless memories we've created together.
            </p>

            <p>
            Maru Vandruuuu💞.
            I love you more than words can say
            </p>
